NaCl
====

A collection of Google Native Client examples designed primarily to help me learn the platform.
Development history so far:

- Counter - simple example to get the build chain working.
- Monte Carlo - a more complicated example to use user input and background threads.
- ImageProc - use OpenCV naclport for image processing in the browser.
- Simple - found out there are some example files in the distribution 
  that simplify things.  This is why it can be a good idea to read the doc 
  occasionally.

Setup
-----
Please see setup.txt for steps needed to install NaCl SDK and naclports on Ubuntu 14.04.  
This works on Amazon AWS t2.micro instance so should be easy to get up and running.
