A collection of Google Native Client examples designed primarily to help me learn the platform.
Development history so far:

- Counter - simple example to get the build chain working.
- Monte Carlo - a more complicated example to use user input and background threads.
- ImageProc - use OpenCV naclport for image processing in the browser.
- Simple - found out there are some example files in the distribution that simplify things.  
  This is why it can be a good idea to read the doc occasionally.
